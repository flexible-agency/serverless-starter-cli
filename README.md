# Serverless starter CLI

**A little helper tool for our [Serverless boilerplate](https://github.com/flexible-agency/serverless-starter).**

## Getting started

Install via:

```shell
npm i -g serverless-starter-cli
```

Or if you'd rather not install permanently, you can replace `starter` with `npx serverless-starter-cli` in the command
examples below.

## Usage

Create a new serverless service using our boilerplate:

```
starter init
```

Create a new function in an existing project:

```
starter fn my-function
```
